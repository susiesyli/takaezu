### Project statement
This project is a data-driven visualization that traces the multidimensional flow and evolution of Toshiko Takaezu’s artistic style over 5 decades, from 1950s to 2000s. Known for her exploration of interiority and the hidden worlds encased within her closed-form ceramics, Takaezu’s work evokes a sense of mystery, silence, and cosmic depth—each piece a universe unto itself.

Reflecting her unique practice of not dating her works, often noting only the decade in which they were created, this timeline encourages viewers to experience her art through the lens of artistic evolution rather than a linear chronology. In this visualization, each time period becomes a constellation, with clusters of planets symbolizing the diverse and evolving body of work she produced. These planets, distinguished by size, color, shape, and brightness, encode the characteristics of her creations: different mediums, scales, and the intricate themes inherent within her enclosed forms.

 The use of color, size, and brightness encodes the diversity of her works: from the delicate table-top ceramics to the monumental sculptures, from bronze to weaving and painting. As the viewer moves through this visual timeline, the evolution of her artistry becomes evident—not only in the growing complexity and form of the works but in the deepening of the hidden, secret worlds she crafted within each piece.
 
By visualizing the constellations of her work across time, this project captures the fluid progression of Takaezu’s artistic journey—her shift between materials, her experimentation with form, and the refinement of her expression of interiority. This celestial metaphor serves as a reflection of the enclosed, silent worlds within her pieces, offering a view into the artist’s expanding universe and her continuous pursuit of expressing what lies beyond the surface.

At its core, this project encapsulates the movement of Takaezu’s art over time, inviting viewers to engage with the hidden worlds within her ceramics and contemplate the silent, cosmic flow that guided her artistic evolution.

## Notes/planning for interactive component

### 1. **Varying Levels of Brightness:**
   - **Brighter Stars for Iconic Works:** Works that were more celebrated, exhibited frequently, or well-documented can shine brighter. They could have a glow effect that makes them appear more "radiant" compared to others. 
   - **Dim Stars for Lesser-Known Works:** For less famous pieces, a softer glow or smaller, more diffused star cluster will make them feel like quiet, hidden gems in the cosmic landscape.

### 2. **Brightness as a Timeline Story:**
   - **Early Career vs. Later Career:** reflect her evolution by gradually increasing or shifting the overall brightness of the clusters as you move through the years. For example, her early works might start with dimmer or more subtle constellations, becoming brighter as she gains more recognition. This would give a sense of growth and creative "intensity" over time.
   
   - **Major Exhibitions or Milestones:** If she had particular years where her work was exhibited in prominent galleries or museums, those constellations could glow especially brightly to mark these pivotal moments in her career.

### 3. **Interaction with Brightness:**
   - **Dimming on Hover:** As an interactive feature, allow other stars to "dim" when hovering over a specific constellation, drawing focus to the work the user is engaging with. It would make each piece feel like its own isolated universe when clicked.
   
   - **Shimmering Effect:** For dynamic visualizations, add a subtle shimmering effect to the brighter works to evoke a sense of "life" or "energy." This could make the constellations feel more alive, like stars pulsing in the night sky.

### 4. **Using Brightness for Grouping:**
   - **Brightness Within Clusters:** Within a single constellation, the brightness of individual stars could correspond to different factors. For example, larger, central stars might represent key elements like the title or size of the work, while smaller, dimmer stars around them could encode additional metadata, such as the year of creation or materials used.
   
   - **Connecting Brightness to Mediums:** Another option is to associate brightness with medium types. For example, ceramics (which she is most famous for) might generally be brighter, while her experiments with other mediums like weaving or bronze could be dimmer, reflecting the relative focus of her artistic journey.

### 5. **Cosmic Atmosphere:**
   -faint "stardust" around the clusters to indicate a body of works that share similar themes or techniques. Brighter clusters would have a denser, glowing stardust field, while dimmer ones would have more subtle, sparse stardust.
