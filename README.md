## Notes/planning for interactive component

### 1. **Varying Levels of Brightness:**
   - **Brighter Stars for Iconic Works:** Works that were more celebrated, exhibited frequently, or well-documented can shine brighter. They could have a glow effect that makes them appear more "radiant" compared to others. 
   - **Dim Stars for Lesser-Known Works:** For less famous pieces, a softer glow or smaller, more diffused star cluster will make them feel like quiet, hidden gems in the cosmic landscape.

### 2. **Brightness as a Timeline Story:**
   - **Early Career vs. Later Career:** reflect her evolution by gradually increasing or shifting the overall brightness of the clusters as you move through the years. For example, her early works might start with dimmer or more subtle constellations, becoming brighter as she gains more recognition. This would give a sense of growth and creative "intensity" over time.
   
   - **Major Exhibitions or Milestones:** If she had particular years where her work was exhibited in prominent galleries or museums, those constellations could glow especially brightly to mark these pivotal moments in her career.

### 3. **Interaction with Brightness:**
   - **Dimming on Hover:** As an interactive feature, allow other stars to "dim" when hovering over a specific constellation, drawing focus to the work the user is engaging with. It would make each piece feel like its own isolated universe when clicked.
   
   - **Shimmering Effect:** For dynamic visualizations, add a subtle shimmering effect to the brighter works to evoke a sense of "life" or "energy." This could make the constellations feel more alive, like stars pulsing in the night sky.

### 4. **Using Brightness for Grouping:**
   - **Brightness Within Clusters:** Within a single constellation, the brightness of individual stars could correspond to different factors. For example, larger, central stars might represent key elements like the title or size of the work, while smaller, dimmer stars around them could encode additional metadata, such as the year of creation or materials used.
   
   - **Connecting Brightness to Mediums:** Another option is to associate brightness with medium types. For example, ceramics (which she is most famous for) might generally be brighter, while her experiments with other mediums like weaving or bronze could be dimmer, reflecting the relative focus of her artistic journey.

### 5. **Cosmic Atmosphere:**
   -faint "stardust" around the clusters to indicate a body of works that share similar themes or techniques. Brighter clusters would have a denser, glowing stardust field, while dimmer ones would have more subtle, sparse stardust.
